> You're beautiful, that's for sure
> You'll never, ever fade
> You're lovely, but it's not for sure
> That I won't ever change

> And though my love is rare
> And though my love is true
> 
> I'm like a bird, I only fly away
> I don't know where my soul is (soul is)
> I don't know where my home is
> And baby, all I need for you to know is
> I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
> I don't know where my soul is (soul is)
> I don't know where my home is
> All I need for you to know is-
> 
> Your faith in me brings me to tears
> Even after all these years end
> And it pains me so much to tell that you don't know me that well

> Though my love is true

> It's not that I wanna say goodbye
> It's just that every time you try
> To tell me, me that you love me, oh
> Each and every single day
> I know I'm gonna have to eventually give you away
> 
> And though my love is rare, rare, rare
> And though my love is true, yeah
> I am just scared that we may fall through
> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
>
