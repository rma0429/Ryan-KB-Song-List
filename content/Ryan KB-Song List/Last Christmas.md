> Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
> But the very next day you gave it away
> This year, to save me from tears
> I'll give it to someone special
> Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
> But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)
> This year, to save me from tears
> I'll give it to someone special (Special)
> 
> Once bitten and twice shy
> I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
> Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
> Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
> 
> (Happy Christmas) I wrapped it up and sent it
> With a note saying, "I love you", I meant it
> Now I know what a fool I've been
> But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again
> 
> Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
> But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)
> This year, to save me from tears
> I'll give it to someone special (Special)
> Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
> But the very next day you gave it away
> This year, to save me from tears
> I'll give it to someone special (Special, oh)
> Oh, oh, baby
> 
> A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
> I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
> My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
> Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
> 
> A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
> A man under cover but you tore me apart
> Ooh-hoo
> Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again
> 
> Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
> But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)
> This year, to save me from tears
> I'll give it to someone special (Special)
> Last Christmas, I gave you my heart (I gave you my heart)

> This year, to save me from tears (Ohh)
> I'll give it to someone special (Special)
> 
> A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)
> A man under cover but you tore him apart
> Maybe next year
> I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
> Special
> Someone
