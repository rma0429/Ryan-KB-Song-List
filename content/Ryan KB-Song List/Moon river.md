> Moon river, wider than a mile
> I'm crossing you in style some day
> Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker
> Wherever you're going, I'm going your way
> 
> Two drifters, off to see the world
> There's such a lot of world to see
> We're after the same rainbow's end, waiting, round the bend
> My Huckleberry Friend, Moon River, and me
