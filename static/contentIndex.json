chest\nAnd you asked me to stay over\nI said, I already told you\nI think that you should get some rest\nI knew I loved you then\nBut you’d never know\n‘Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go\nI knew I needed you\nBut I never showed\nBut I wanna stay with you\nUntil we’re grey and old\nJust say you won’t let go\nJust say you won’t let go\nI’ll wake you up with some\nBreakfast in bed\nI’ll bring you coffee\nWith a kiss on your head\nAnd I’ll take the kids to school\nWave them goodbye\nAnd I’ll thank my lucky stars\nFor that night\nWhen you looked over your shoulder\nFor a minute I forget that I’m older\nI wanna dance with you right now, oh\nAnd you look as beautiful as ever\nAnd I swear that every day you’ll get better\nYou make me feel this way somehow\nI’m so in love with you\nAnd I hope you know\nDarling, your love is more than worth its weight in gold\nWe’ve come so far, my dear\nLook how we’ve grown\nAnd I wanna stay with you\nUntil we’re grey and old\nJust say you won’t let go\nJust say you won’t let go\nI wanna live with you\nEven when we’re ghosts\n‘Cause you were always there for me\nWhen I needed you most\nI’m gonna love you ‘til\nMy lungs give out\nI promise ‘til death we part\nLike in our vows\nSo I wrote this song for you\nNow everybody knows\nThat it’s just you and me\nUntil we’re grey and old\nJust say you won’t let go\nJust say you won’t let

Steph\n\n\n[Lyrics]\n寂寞圍繞著電視　垂死堅持　在兩點半消失\n多希望有人來陪我　度過末日\n空虛敲打著意志　彷彿這時間已靜止\n我懷疑人們的生活　有所掩飾\n阿哈　垂死堅持　阿哈　已靜止 (全部消失)\n衝動在瞬間消失　夢被稀釋 不停轉動著手指\n我幻想美麗的生活 何時開始\n時光不經意流逝 像顆在耗費的電池\n我感到有點失落 無法抑制\n阿哈　垂死堅持 阿哈　已靜止 (全部消失)\n"},"Ryan-KB-Song-List/中文/魚仔":{"slug":"Ryan-KB-Song-List/中文/魚仔","filePath":"Ryan KB-Song List/中文/魚仔.md","title":"魚仔","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Singer/KEY: Steph [Eb] , 丰 [E]\nStyle:
