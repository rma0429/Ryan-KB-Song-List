> Last Christmas, I gave you my heart<br>
> But the very next day you gave it away<br>
> This year, to save me from tears<br>
> I'll give it to someone special<br>
> Last Christmas, I gave you my heart<br>

> Once bitten and twice shy<br>
> I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye<br>
> Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?<br>
> Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me<br>
> <br>
> (Happy Christmas) I wrapped it up and sent it<br>
> With a note saying, "I love you", I meant it<br>
> Now I know what a fool I've been<br>
> But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again<br>

> Last Christmas, I gave you my heart<br>

> This year, to save me from tears<br>
> I'll give it to someone special (Special, oh)<br>
> Oh, oh, baby<br>
> <br>
> A crowded room, friends with tired eyes<br>
> I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice<br>
> My God, I thought you were someone to rely on<br>
> Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on<br>
> <br>
> A face on a lover with a fire in his heart<br>
> A man under cover but you tore me apart<br>
> Ooh-hoo<br>
> Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again<br>

> A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)<br>
> A man under cover but you tore him apart<br>
> Maybe next year<br>
> I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special<br>
