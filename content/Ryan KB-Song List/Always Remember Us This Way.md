> 
> [1]
> That Arizona sky burnin' in your eyes
> You look at me and, babe, I wanna catch on fire
> It's buried in my soul like California gold
> You found the light in me that I couldn't find
> [1]
> So when I'm all choked up
> And I can't find the words
> Every time we say goodbye
> Baby, it hurts
> When the sun goes down
> And the band won't play
> I'll always remember us this way
> [2]
> Lovers in the night
> Poets tryin' to write
> We don't know how to rhyme
> But, damn, we try
> But all I really know
> You're where I wanna go
> The part of me that's you will never die
> [3]
> So when I'm all choked up
> And I can't find the words
> Every time we say goodbye
> Baby, it hurts [2]
> When the sun goes down
> And the band won't play
> I'll always remember us this way
> [4]
> Oh, yeah
> I don't wanna be just a memory, baby, yeah
> Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
> Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
> Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
> [4]
> So when I'm all choked up
> And I can't find the words
> Every time we say goodbye
> Baby, it hurts  [3]
> When the sun goes down
> And the band won't play
> I'll always remember us this way, way, yeah [end 1]
> When you look at me
> And the whole world fades
> I'll always remember us this way
