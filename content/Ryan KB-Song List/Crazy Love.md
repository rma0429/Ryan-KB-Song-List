> [Lyrics]
> 
> 
> I can hear her heartbeat from a thousand miles
> Hear the heavens open every time she smiles
> And when I come to her that's where I belong
> Yet, I'm run into to her like a river strong
> 
> She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
> She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
> 
> She got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down
> And when I come home to her when the sun goes down
> Takes my troubles all away, take away my grief
> Take away my heartache, in the night like a thief
> 
> She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
> She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
> 
> Yes I need, yes I need her in the daytime
> And oh I need, yes I need her in the night
> I want to throw my arms all around her
> To kiss and hug and kiss and hug her tight
> And oh
> 
> And when I'm returning from so far away
> She gives me sweet sweet lovin', brighten up my day
> It make me righteous and it makes me whole
> Makes me mellow, down into my soul
> 
> She, she gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
> She gives me love, love, love, crazy love
> One more time, she gives love, la la la love (crazy love)
> When I wake up in the morning
> She gives me love, love, love,
> Crazy Love
