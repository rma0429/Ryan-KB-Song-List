> Kiss me, out of the bearded barley
> Nightly, beside the green, green grass
> Swing, swing, (swing, swing) swing the spinning step
> You wear those shoes and I will wear that dress
> 
> [3]
> Oh, kiss me, beneath the milky twilight
> Lead me out on the moonlit floor
> Lift your open hand
> Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
> Silver moon's sparkling
> So kiss me
> 
> [2]
> Kiss me, (kiss me) down by the broken tree house
> Swing me, (swing me) upon its hanging tire
> Bring, bring, (bring, bring) bring your flowered hat
> We'll take the trail marked on your father's map
>

> Oh, kiss me, beneath the milky twilight
> Lead me out on the moonlit floor
> Lift your open hand
> Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
