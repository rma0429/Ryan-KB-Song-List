> 
> Only you can make all this world seem right
> Only you can make the darkness bright
> Only you and you alone can thrill me like you do
> And fill my heart with love for only you
> 
> Oh, only you can do make all this change in me
> For it's true, you are my destiny
> When you hold my hand I understand the magic that you do
> You're my dream come true, my one and only you
> 
> Oh oh, only you can do make this change in me
> For it's true, you are my destiny
> When you hold my hand I understand the magic that you do
> You're my dream come true, my one and only you
