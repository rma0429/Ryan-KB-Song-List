> Well if you ever plan to motor west
> Travel my way, take the highway that's the best
> Get your kicks on Route 66
> 
> Well it winds from Chicago to L.A.
> More than two thousand miles all the way
> Get your kicks on Route 66
> 
> Well it goes to St. Louis, down to Missouri
> Oklahoma City looks so, so pretty
> You'll see Amarillo, Gallup, New Mexico
> Flagstaff, Arizona, don't forget Wynonna
> Kingman, Barstow, San Bernardino
> 
> You get hip to this kind of tip
> And go take that California trip
> Get your kicks on Route 66
