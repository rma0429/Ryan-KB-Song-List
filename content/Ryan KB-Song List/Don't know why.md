> I waited 'til I saw the sun
> I don't know why I didn't come
> I left you by the house of fun
> I don't know why I didn't come
> I don't know why I didn't come

> [1]
> When I saw the break of day
> I wished that I could fly away
> Instead of kneeling in the sand
> Catching teardrops in my hand

> My heart is drenched in wine
> But you'll be on my mind
> Forever

> [2]
> Out across the endless sea
> I would die in ecstasy
> But I'll be a bag of bones
> Driving down the road alone

> My heart is drenched in wine

> Something has to make you run
> I don't know why I didn't come
> I feel as empty as a drum
> I don't know why I didn't come
> I don't know why I didn't come
> I don't know why I didn't come
