> The falling leaves
> 
> Drift by the window
> 
> The autumn leaves
> 
> Of red and gold
> 
> I see your lips
> 
> The summer kisses
> 
> The sunburned hands
> 
> I used to hold
> 
> Since you went away
> 
> The days grow long
> 
> And soon I'll hear
> 
> Old winter's song
> 
> But I miss you most of all
> 
> My darling
> 
> When autumn leaves
> 
> Start to fall
> 
> Since you went away
> 
> The days grow long
> 
> And soon I'll hear
> 
> Old winter's song
> 
> But I miss you most of all
> 
> My darling
> 
> When autumn leaves
> 
> Start to fall
