> Tall and tan and young and lovely
> The girl from Ipanema goes walking
> And when she passes
> Each one she passes goes - ah

> When she walks, she's like a samba
> That swings so cool and sways so gentle
> That when she passes
> Each one she passes goes - ooh

> [4]
> (Ooh) But I watch her so sadly
> How can I tell her I love her
> Yes I would give my heart gladly
> But each day, when she walks to the sea
> She looks straight ahead, not at me
