> 
> You are the sunshine of my life
> That's why I'll always be around
> You are the apple of my eye
> Forever you'll stay in my heart
> 
> I feel like this is the beginning
> Though I've loved you for a million years
> And if I thought our love was ending
> I'd find myself drowning in my own tears, whoa, oh, oh
> 
> You are the sunshine of my life, yeah
> That's why I'll always stay around, mmm, mmm, yeah, yeah
> You are the apple of my eye
> Forever you'll stay in my heart
> 
> You must have known that I was lonely
> Because you came to my rescue
> And I know that this must be heaven
> How could so much love be inside of you?
> Whoa, whoa
> 
> You are the sunshine of my life, yeah
> That's why I'll always stay around, mmm (baby)
> You are the apple of my eye
> Forever you'll stay in my heart, yeah
> 
> You are the sunshine of my life, baby
> That's why I'll always stay around
