> 
> 
> Yeah
> Sunday morning, rain is falling
> Steal some covers, share some skin (I like that)
> Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
> You twist to fit the mold that I am in
> 
> But things just get so crazy
> Living life gets hard to do
> And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
> That someday it would lead me back to you
> That someday it would lead me back to you (oh, someday)
> 
> That may be all I need
> In darkness, she is all I see (all I see)
> Come and rest your bones with me
> Driving slow on Sunday morning
> And I never want to leave
> 
> Yeah, fingers trace your every outline, oh yeah, yeah
> Yeah, paint a picture with my hand, oh, woah
> And back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
> Change the weather, still together when it ends
> 
> That may be all I need (all I need)
> In darkness, she is all I see
> Come and rest your bones with me
> Driving slow on Sunday morning
> And I never want to leave
> 
> Yeah
> 
> Oh yeah
> 
> But things just get so crazy living
> Life gets hard to do (life gets hard)
> Sunday morning rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
> Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you
> Yeah (someday oh, someday oh)
> Find a way to bring myself back home to you
> You may not know
> 
> That may be all I need
> In darkness, she is all I see (you are all I see)
> Come and rest your bones with me
> Driving slow on Sunday morning, driving slow
> Yeah, yeah
> 
> Ah, yeah, yeah
> Ah, yeah, yeah
> Ah, yeah, yeah
> Ah, yeah, yeah
> Ah, yeah, yeah
> 
> There's a flower in your hair
> I'm a flower in your hair
> Oh, yeah, yeah
> Yeah, yeah, oh
> Woah, oh, yeah
> 
> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
> (All I need)
> (All I see)
