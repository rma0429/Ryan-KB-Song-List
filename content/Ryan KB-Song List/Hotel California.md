> On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair<br>
> Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air<br>
> Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light<br>
> My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim<br>
> I had to stop for the night<br>
> There she stood in the doorway<br>
> I heard the mission bell<br>
> And I was thinking to myself<br>
> "This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"<br>
> Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way<br>
> There were voices down the corridor<br>
> I thought I heard them say<br>
> <br>
> Welcome to the Hotel California<br>
> Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)<br>
> Such a lovely face<br>
> Plenty of room at the Hotel California<br>
> Any time of year (Any time of year)<br>
> You can find it here<br>
> <br>
> Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends<br>
> She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends<br>
> How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat<br>
> Some dance to remember, some dance to forget<br>
> <br>
> So I called up the Captain<br>
> "Please bring me my wine."<br>
> He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine."<br>
> And still those voices are calling from far away<br>
> Wake you up in the middle of the night<br>
> Just to hear them say<br>
> <br>
> Welcome to the Hotel California<br>
> Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)<br>
> Such a lovely face<br>
> They livin' it up at the Hotel California<br>
> What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)<br>
> Bring your alibis<br>
> <br>
> Mirrors on the ceiling<br>
> The pink champagne on ice<br>
> And she said "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"<br>
> And in the master's chambers<br>
> They gathered for the feast<br>
> They stab it with their steely knives<br>
> But they just can't kill the beast<br>
> <br>
> Last thing I remember<br>
> I was running for the door<br>
> I had to find the passage back to the place I was before<br>
> "Relax," said the night man<br>
> "We are programmed to receive<br>
> You can check-out any time you like<br>
> But you can never leave!"<br>
