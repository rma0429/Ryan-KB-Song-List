> 
> You are my sunshine
> My only sunshine
> You make me happy
> When skies are gray
> You'll never know, dear
> How much I love you
> Please don't take
> My sunshine away
> 
> The other night, dear
> As I lay sleeping
> I dreamed I held you
> In my arms
> When I awoke, dear
> I was mistaken
> So I hung my head and cried
> 
> You are my sunshine
> My only sunshine
> You make me happy
> When skies are gray
> You'll never know, dear
> How much I love you
> Please don't take
> My sunshine away
