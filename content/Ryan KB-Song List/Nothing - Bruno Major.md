> Tracksuits and red wine, movies for two
> We'll take off our phones and we'll turn off our shoes
> We'll play Nintendo though I always lose
> Cos you watch the TV while I'm watching you
> There's not many people I'd honestly say I don't mind losing to
> But there's nothing like doing nothing with you
> 
> Dumb conversation, we lose track of time
> Have I told you lately I'm grateful you're mine
> We watch "The Notebook" for the 17th time
> I'll say it's stupid, then you catch me crying
> We're not making out on a boat in the rain or in a house I painted blue
> But there's nothing like doing nothing with you
> 
> So shut all the windows and lock all the doors
> We're not looking for no one, don't need nothing more
> You'll bite my lip and I'll want you more
> Until we end up in a heap on the floor
> 
> Mmmmmmm...
> 
> You could be dancing on table tops wearing high heels
> Drinking until the world spins like a wheel
> But tonight your apartment has so much appeal
> Who needs stars, we've got a roof
> And there's nothing like doing nothing with you
> No, there's nothing like doing nothing with you
>
