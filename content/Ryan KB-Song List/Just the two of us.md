> 
> I see the crystal raindrops fall
> And the beauty of it all
> Is when the sun comes shining through
> To make those rainbows in my mind
> When I think of you sometime
> And I want to spend some time with you
> 
> Just the two of us
> We can make it if we try
> Just the two of us
> (Just the two of us)
> Just the two of us
> Building castles in the sky
> Just the two of us
> You and I
> 
> We look for love, no time for tears
> Wasted water's all that is
> And it don't make no flowers grow
> Good things might come to those who wait
> Not for those who wait too late
> We gotta go for all we know
> 
> Just the two of us
> We can make it if we try
> Just the two of us
> (Just the two of us)
> Just the two of us
> Building them castles in the sky
> Just the two of us
> You and I
> 
> Just the two of us
> We can make it just the two of us
> Just the two of us
> We can make it just the two of us
> Just the two of us
> We can make it just the two of us
> Just the two of us
> We can make it just the two of us
> Just the two of us
> We can make it just the two of us
> Just the two of us
> We can make it just the two of us
> Just the two of us
> We can make it just the two of us
> Just the two of us
> We can make it just the two of us
> Just the two of us
> We can make it just the two of us
> 
> I hear the crystal raindrops fall
> On the window down the hall
> And it becomes the morning dew
> And, darling, when the morning comes
> And I see the morning sun
> I want to be the one with you
> 
> Just the two of us
> We can make it if we try
> Just the two of us
> (Just the two of us)
> Just the two of us
> Building big castles way on high
> Just the two of us
> You and I
> 
> (Just the two of us)
> Yes, the two of us
> (We can make it just the two of us)
> Let's get it together, babe
> (Just the two of us)
> Yes, the two of us
> (We can make it just the two of us
> Just the two of us
> We can make it just the two of us
> Just the two of us
> We can make it just the two of us
> Just the two of us
> We can make it just the two of us
> Just the two of us
