> 
> 
> When I was young
> I'd listen to the radio
> Waitin' for my favorite songs
> Waiting they played I'd sing along
> It made me smile
> 
> Those were such happy times
> And not so long ago
> How I wondered where they'd gone
> But they're back again
> Just like a long lost friend
> All the songs I loved so well
> 
> every sha-la-la-la
> Every wo-wo-wo
> Still shines
> Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
> That they're starting to sing's
> So fine
> 
> When they get to the part
> Where he's breakin' her heart
> It can really make me cry
> Just like before
> It's yesterday once more
> 
> Shu be du why why
> Shu be du why why
> 
> Lookin' back on how it was
> In years gone by
> zAnd the good times that I had
> Makes today seem rather sad
> So much has changed
> 
> It was songs of love that
> I would sing to then
> And I'd memorize each word
> Those old melodies
> Still sound so good to me
> As they melt the years away
> 
> Every sha-la-la-la
> Every wo-wo-wo
> Still shines
> Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
> That they're starting to sing's
> So fine
> 
> All my best memories
> Come back clearly to me
> Some can even make me cry
> Just like before
> It's yesterday once more
> 
> Shu be du why why
> 
> RePT.
