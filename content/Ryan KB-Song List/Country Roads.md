> Almost heaven, west Virginia
> Blue ridge mountains, Shenandoah River
> Life is old there, older than the trees
> Younger than the mountains
> Growing like a breeze
> 
> Country road, take me home
> To the place I belong
> West Virginia, mountain mamma
> Take me home, country road
> 
> All my memories gathered round her
> Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
> Dark and dusty painted on the sky
> Misty taste of moonshine
> Teardrop in my eye
> 
> Country road, take me home
> To the place I belong
> West Virginia, mountain mamma
> Take me home, country road
> 
> I hear her voice in the morning hours she calls me
> Radio reminds me of my home far away
> And driving down the road I get a feeling
> That I should've been home yesterday
> 
> Country road, take me home
> To the place I belong
> West Virginia, mountain mamma
> Take me home, country road
> 
> Country road, take me home
> To the place I belong
> West Virginia, mountain mamma
> Take me home, country road
> Take me home, country road
> Take me home, country road
