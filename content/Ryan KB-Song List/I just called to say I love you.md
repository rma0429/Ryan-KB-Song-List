> No New Year's Day to celebrate
> No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
> No first of spring
> No song to sing
> In fact here's just another ordinary day
> 
> [2]
> No April rain
> No flowers bloom
> No wedding Saturday within the month of June
> But what it is, is something true
> Made up of these three words that I must say to you
> 
> [3]
> I just called to say I love you
> I just called to say how much I care
> I just called to say I love you
> And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

> No summer's high
> No warm July
> No harvest moon to light one tender August night
> No autumn breeze
> No falling leaves
> Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies

> No Libra sun
> No Halloween
> No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
> But what it is, though old so new
> To fill your heart like no three words could ever do
>

> I just called to say I love you
> I just called to say how much I care, I do
> I just called to say I love you
