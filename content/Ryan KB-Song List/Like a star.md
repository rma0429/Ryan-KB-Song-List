> [in Piano]
> Just like a star across my sky,
> Just like an angel off the page,
> You have appeared to my life,
> Feel like I'll never be the same,
> Just like a song in my heart,
> Just like oil on my hands,
> Honour to love you
> 
> Still I wonder why it is,
> I don't argue like this,
> With anyone but you,
> We do it all the time,
> Blowing out my mind,
> 
> [in 1-1]
> You've got this look I can't describe,
> You make me feel I'm alive,
> When everything else is au fait,
> Without a doubt you're on my side,
> Heaven has been away too long,
> Can't find the words to write this song,
> Of your love,

> Now I have come to understand,
> The way it is,
> It's not a secret anymore,
> 'cause we've been through that before,
> From tonight I know that you're the only one,
> I've been confused and in the dark,
> Now I understand,
