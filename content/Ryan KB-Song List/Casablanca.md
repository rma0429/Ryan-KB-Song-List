> 
> 
> I fell in love with you watching Casablanca
> Back row of the drive-in show in the flickering light
> Popcorn and cokes beneath the stars
> Became champagne and caviar
> Making love on a long hot summer's night
> 
> I thought you fell in love with me watching Casablanca
> Holding hands 'neath the paddle fans in Rick's candle lit café
> Hiding in the shadows from the spies
> Moroccan moonlight in your eyes
> Making magic at the movies in my old Chevrolet
> 
> Ooh, a kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca
> But a kiss is not a kiss without your sigh
> Please come back to me in Casablanca
> I love you more and more each day as time goes by
> 
> in-solo
> 
> I guess there are many broken hearts in Casablanca
> You know, I've never really been there, so I don't know
> I guess our love story will never be seen
> On the big wide silver screen
> But it hurt just as bad, when I had to watch you go
> 
> Ooh, a kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca
> But a kiss is not a kiss without your sigh
> Please come back to me in Casablanca
> I love you more and more each day as time goes by
> 
> Ooh, a kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca
> But a kiss is not a kiss without your sigh
> Please come back to me in Casablanca
> I love you more and more each day as time goes by
> I love you more and more each day as time goes by
