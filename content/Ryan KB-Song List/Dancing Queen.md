> 
> Ooh, you can dance, you can jive
> Having the time of your life
> Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
> Digging the dancing queen
> 
> Friday night and the lights are low
> Looking out for a place to go
> Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
> You come to look for a king
> 
> Anybody could be that guy
> Night is young and the music's high
> With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
> You're in the mood for a dance
> And when you get the chance
> 
> You are the dancing queen
> Young and sweet, only seventeen
> Dancing queen
> Feel the beat from the tambourine
> Oh, yeah
> 
> You can dance, you can jive
> Having the time of your life
> Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
> Digging the dancing queen
> 
> You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
> Leave them burning and then you're gone
> Looking out for another, anyone will do
> You're in the mood for a dance
> And when you get the chance
> 
> You are the dancing queen
> Young and sweet, only seventeen
> Dancing queen
> Feel the beat from the tambourine
> Oh, yeah
> 
> You can dance, you can jive
> Having the time of your life
> Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
> Digging the dancing queen
> 
> Digging the dancing queen
