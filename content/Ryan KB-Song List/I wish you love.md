> 
> 
> I wish you bluebirds in the spring
> To give your heart a song to sing
> And then a kiss
> But more than this
> 
> I wish you love
> And in July a lemonade
> To cool you in some leafy glade
> I wish you health
> And more than wealth
> 
> My breaking heart and I agree
> That you and I could never be
> So with my best, my very best
> I set you free
> I wish you shelter from the storm
> A cosy fire to keep you warm
> But most of all
> When snowflakes fall
> 
> I wish you love
> My breaking heart and I agree
> That you and I could never be
> So with my best, my very best
> I set you free
> 
> I wish you shelter from the storm
> A cosy fire to keep you warm
> But most of all
> 
> When snowflakes fall
> When snowflakes fall
> When snowflakes fall
> When snowflakes fall
> When snowflakes fall
