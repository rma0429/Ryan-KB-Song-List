> Verse 1]
> When the night has come
> And the land is dark
> And the moon is the only light we'll see
> No, I won't be afraid
> Oh, I won't be afraid
> Just as long as you stand, stand by me
> 
> [Chorus]
> So darlin', darlin', stand by me
> Oh, stand by me
> Oh, stand
> Stand by me, stand by me
> 
> [Verse 2]
> If the sky that we look upon
> Should tumble and fall
> Or the mountains should crumble to the sea
> I won't cry, I won't cry
> No, I won't shed a tear
> Just as long as you stand, stand by me
> 
> [Chorus]
> And darlin', darlin', stand by me
> Oh, stand by me
> Woah, stand now
> Stand by me, stand by m
