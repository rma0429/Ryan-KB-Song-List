> 
> Why do birds suddenly appear
> Every time you are near?
> Just like me, they long to be
> Close to you
> 
> Why do stars fall down from the sky
> Every time you walk by?
> Just like me, they long to be
> Close to you
> 
> On the day that you were born the angels got together
> And decided to create a dream come true
> So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold
> And starlight in your eyes of blue
> 
> That is why all the girls in town
> Follow you all around
> Just like me, they long to be
> Close to you
> 
> On the day that you were born the angels got together

> Wa, close to you
> Wa, close to you
> Ha, close to you
> La, close to you
